    <h2>A very rewarding dish</h2>
    <p>The other recipes on this project were ridiculously simple. Nevertheless, they were presented because of their nutrients and their praticity to <br>
        prepare every day, at any moment you need. But, the Maple Glazed Chicken with Sweet Potatos is the kind of dish you will have to dedicate<br>
         some time to cook and the effort will be worth it once you eat it. Here we have, like in the other recipes, food with a great amount of nutrients <br>
         and protein, mostly from the chicken, of course. Just enjoy the explosion of flavors provided by the salty taste of the chicken, and the sweetness <br>
         of the potatoes and the maple glaze.</p>
