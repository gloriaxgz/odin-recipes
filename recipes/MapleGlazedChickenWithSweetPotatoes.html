    <h2>A very rewarding dish</h2>
    <p>The other recipes on this project were ridiculously simple. Nevertheless, they were presented because of their nutrients and their praticity to <br>
        prepare every day, at any moment you need. But, the Maple Glazed Chicken with Sweet Potatos is the kind of dish you will have to dedicate<br>
         some time to cook and the effort will be worth it once you eat it. Here we have, like in the other recipes, food with a great amount of nutrients <br>
         and protein, mostly from the chicken, of course. Just enjoy the explosion of flavors provided by the salty taste of the chicken, and the sweetness <br>
         of the potatoes and the maple glaze.</p>
         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
             <li>1,5 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
             <li>1 pound chicken tenders</li>
             <li>2 teaspoons steak seasoning</li>
             <li>half-cup maple syrup</li>
             <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
             <li>half-cup sliced green onions</li>
         </ul>
         <h2>Instructions</h2>
         <ol>
             <li>Place the sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, <br>and
                simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Mash the potatoes, and set aside.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle chicken tenders with steak seasoning; heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook the chicken tenders until the <br>
                    meat is lightly browned and no longer pink inside, 5 to 8 minutes per side. Remove the chicken, and set aside. Stir the maple syrup <br>
                    into the skillet, scraping up and dissolving any browned flavor bits from the skillet. Bring to a boil, simmer for 2 minutes, and stir in<br>
                    the green onions.
                </li>
                <li>To serve, place the mashed sweet potatoes onto a serving platter, top with the chicken tenders, and pour the maple sauce over the chicken.</li>
         </ol>
