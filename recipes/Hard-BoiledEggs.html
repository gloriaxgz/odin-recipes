        <ul>
            <li>uh.........eggs... (and water)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Fill a saucepan about a quarter of the way with cold water. Place the eggs in a single layer at the bottom of the saucepan. Add more water so that the eggs <br>
            are covered by at least an inch or two of water.</li>
            <li>Leave the pan uncovered. Turn the heat to high and bring the water to a rolling boil. Depending on how 
            cooked you like your hard boiled eggs, the eggs <br>should be done perfectly after sitting for 10-12 minutes. That said, depending on your altitude, the shape 
            of the pan, the size of the eggs, and the ratio of<br> water to eggs, it can take a few minutes more.
            <li>Strain the hot water from the pan, careful not to dump out the eggs, and run cold water over them until they are cool to the touch. This will stop the eggs<br> 
                from cooking further and make them easier to peel.</li>
            <li>It is easier to peel the eggs under a bit of running water.The best way to store hard boiled eggs is unpeeled in a covered container in the refrigerator. <br>
                Eggs can release odors in the fridge which is why it helps to keep them covered.They should be eaten within 5 days. Peeled eggs should be eaten within  <br>a
                day or two.</li>
       </ol>
